Description: FUSE based filesystem for LXC
 LXCFS provides a FUSE based filesystem to improve the LXC experience
 within the containers.
 .
 This filesystem offers both a cgroupfs-like view for use by
 unprivileged containers which wouldn't otherwise be allowed to mount
 cgroupfs. And a set of files that are meant to be bind-mounted over
 their /proc equivalent to make them cgroup-aware.
